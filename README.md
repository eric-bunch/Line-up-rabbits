# Line-up-rabbits

I remembered to copy the word problem, so for the setup refer to the file 
line_up_the_captives.txt

I did not finish this one in time, but was able to come up with code that 
correctly counts the number of ways to line up the rabbits later in the day 
after the deadline passed. I'm very sure that it's correct because I wrote 
a code snippet (the commented part at the bottom of line_up_the_captives.py) 
that computed the number of ways to line up the rabbits, but in an extremely 
inefficient way. Then I had some lines of code that checked the two methods 
against each other for fairly small numbers. Even though the numbers were small, 
there were still a good number of cases, and I think the numbers were big enough 
to see any strange behaviour that might have occured. 

Although I'm very confident the code I have written computes the correct thing, 
it still runs too slowly on some larger numbers. But it is still a pretty early 
version of the code. I still need to go through and refactor it to speed some 
things up.
